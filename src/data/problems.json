    "hint": "For chronic respiratory acidosis, HCO₃⁻ increases ~4 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg rise in PaCO₂ above 40 mm Hg.",

    "question": "UV–Vis spectrum image shows absorbance maximum at 280 nm with high A280/A260 ratio. What does this suggest about sample purity?",
    "hint": "Proteins absorb at 280 nm primarily due to aromatic residues; nucleic acids absorb strongly at 260 nm.",
    "answer": "High protein content / contamination or a protein-rich sample; sample likely protein and not pure nucleic acid.",
    "solution": "High A280 relative to A260 suggests protein presence; pure DNA has A260/A280 ≈ 1.8, so a higher A280 suggests protein contamination or a protein sample.",

    "hint": "Consider how Km and Vmax change and their effects on intercepts.",
    "answer": "Noncompetitive inhibition (Vmax decreased, Km unchanged).",
    "solution": "A noncompetitive inhibitor reduces Vmax (raising 1/Vmax on y-axis) without affecting Km (so x-intercept unchanged). Thus the lines intersect on the x-axis.",

    "hint": "Two titratable protons yield two equivalence points; buffer regions correspond to pKa values.",
    "answer": "Each equivalence point corresponds to neutralization of one acidic proton; midpoints between start and equivalence give pKa values; pH at each equivalence reflects strength of remaining conjugate base.",
    "solution": "A diprotic acid has two ionizable protons; titration shows two equivalence points. The pH at half-equivalence points equals pKa1 and pKa2. If spaced well, you can estimate both pKa values from buffer plateaus.",

    "hint": "Use Henderson–Hasselbalch initially; for addition, convert moles and recalc ratio.",
    "answer": "Initial pH = 4.46; after HCl pH ≈ 4.39",
    "solution": "Initial ratio [A⁻]/[HA]=0.100/0.200=0.5 → pH=4.76+log(0.5)=4.76−0.301=4.459≈4.46. Moles: HA=0.200 mol, A⁻=0.100 mol. Add 0.010 mol HCl: HCl reacts with A⁻ making HA: new HA=0.200+0.010=0.210 mol; A⁻=0.100−0.010=0.090 mol. New ratio=0.090/0.210=0.4286 → pH=4.76+log(0.4286)=4.76−0.368=4.392≈4.39."

    "hint": "Odd-chain yields propionyl-CoA which is converted to succinyl-CoA (glucogenic) producing one additional ATP equivalent after TCA processing; compute β-oxidation cycles = (n−1)/2.",
    "answer": "Approx ≈ 101 ATP (estimate).",
    "solution": "For 15C: number of acetyl-CoA = 7 acetyl-CoA + 1 propionyl-CoA. β-oxidation cycles = 7 cycles producing 7 FADH2 and 7 NADH → 7*(1.5+2.5)=28 ATP. Acetyl-CoA (7) through TCA: 7×10 = 70 ATP. Propionyl-CoA processing yields ~3 ATP equivalents. Subtract 2 ATP activation → ≈ 28+70+3−2 ≈ 99–101; common accepted ≈101 depending on rounding."

    "answer": "Measure v vs [S] at several [S] with and without inhibitor; plot Lineweaver–Burk: competitive shows lines intersect at y-axis (same 1/Vmax), noncompetitive intersects at x-axis (same −1/Km).",
    "solution": "Perform enzyme assays across a range of [S] in absence and presence of fixed [inhibitor]. Plot 1/v vs 1/[S]. Competitive increases apparent Km (lines intersect at y), noncompetitive decreases Vmax (y-intercept increases) with unchanged Km."

If you increase the activity of enzyme 1 by 100% (double its activity), what approximate percent change in steady-state pathway flux would you expect?",
    "hint": "Flux change ≈ control coefficient × fractional change in enzyme activity.",
    "answer": "Approximately 10% increase in flux (0.10 × 100% = 10%).",
