    "answer": "0.48",
    "solution": "p = 0.6, q = 0.4. Frequency of Aa = 2pq = 2(0.6)(0.4) = 0.48."

    "question": "In a Drosophila cross, two genes show a recombination frequency of 12%. What does this tell you about their map distance?",
    "hint": "Recombination frequency (in %) ≈ map distance in centiMorgans (cM).",
    "answer": "The genes are 12 cM apart",
    "solution": "A recombination frequency of 12% indicates the genes are 12 map units (centiMorgans) apart on the chromosome."

    "question": "When two genes are linked, do their alleles always stay together during gamete formation? Explain.",
    "hint": "Consider crossing over.",
    "answer": "No; crossing over can separate linked alleles.",
    "solution": "Although linked genes are on the same chromosome, crossing over (recombination) can exchange DNA segments between homologous chromosomes, producing recombinant gametes with separated allele combinations."

    "question": "What is the primary difference between apoptosis and necrosis?",
    "hint": "Apoptosis is programmed; necrosis is traumatic.",
    "answer": "Apoptosis is controlled programmed cell death; necrosis is uncontrolled death from injury",
    "solution": "Apoptosis is an orderly, energy-dependent process that cleanly packages cellular contents without inflammatory response. Necrosis is traumatic cell death from injury, causing cell lysis and inflammation."

    "hint": "Partial pressure equals mole fraction times pure component vapor pressure.",
    "answer": "Partial pressure of each component equals its mole fraction times its pure vapor pressure",
    "solution": "Raoult's law: P_A = X_A × P_A°, where P_A is partial pressure, X_A is mole fraction, and P_A° is the pure component vapor pressure."

    "hint": "Consider oxidation state of carbonyl carbon.",
    "answer": "Aldehyde",
    "solution": "In IUPAC nomenclature, aldehyde (−CHO) has higher priority than ketone (−CO−) because the carbonyl carbon is bonded to more hydrogen atoms (oxidation state difference)."

    "hint": "Think about oxidation-reduction reactions and energy status.",
    "answer": "High NAD⁺/NADH ratio favors catabolic oxidation reactions",
    "solution": "A high NAD⁺/NADH ratio drives oxidation reactions forward, allowing glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to proceed efficiently. The cell maintains this by transferring NADH electrons to the electron transport chain."

    "hint": "System shifts to decrease the number of gas moles.",
    "answer": "Equilibrium shifts toward the side with fewer moles of gas",
    "solution": "Increased pressure favors the side with fewer moles of particles (gases). The system shifts in that direction to reduce pressure and re-establish equilibrium."

    "answer": "Absorbs green light (550 nm); appears magenta/red",
    "solution": "550 nm corresponds to green light. When green is absorbed, the complementary color—magenta—is transmitted/reflected, making the solution appear magenta or reddish."
